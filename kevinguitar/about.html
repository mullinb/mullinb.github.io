                            Kevin began studying classical guitar at the age of six. He began learning jazz guitar in high school, eventually winning First Place in the Texas All-State Jazz Competition. He has studied Jazz at the Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California and at the University of Texas at Austin. Among other musical projects, Kevin has been lead guitarist and co-songwriter of progressive rock band Medulla, since 2011. His future plans include resuming his study classical guitar at the university level, here in Berlin.
                            <br><br>
                            Kevin has taught guitar lessons for the last several years. Maintaining a personal, amateur interest in meditiation, meditation is not a part of Kevin's pedogogy, but does inform his personal approach to guitar study and music in general. In this view, building knowledge and skill upon sound foundations help to make learning feel effortless, and even more personally rewarding.
